# HFSS-50ohm-Antenna-Design

This is my **first HFSS design project**, where I modeled and simulated a **50 ohm microstrip antenna** using ANSYS HFSS 2025 R2.  
The goal was to analyze S-parameters and study resonance behavior.

ðŸ“Š Results
- Dual-band resonance at **~3 GHz and ~6 GHz**
- S11 < â€“10 dB (good impedance matching)
- Model includes substrate (FR-4/epoxy), ground plane, and lumped port feed.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
- ANSYS HFSS 2025 R2 (Student Version)
- Windows 10

ðŸ“· Screenshots
- 3D model in HFSS  
- S-parameter plot  

ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Add **radiation pattern, gain, directivity analysis**
- Perform **parametric study** (effect of substrate & dimensions)
- Explore **fabrication & measurement** in the future



ðŸ“Œ This project marks the beginning of my RF & antenna design journey. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
